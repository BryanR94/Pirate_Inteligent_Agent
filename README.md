# Pirate_Inteligent_Agent

The code that I was given in this course project was the elements of environment, experience for replay, build model, and play game. The code that I was told to create was the Q-training algorithm. I was given a skeleton implementation but my task was to implement deep-Q learning and to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. Computer scientists are individuals that work on the theoretical side of computer systems and that they develop models to be abe to discover designs that yield useful benefits. I approach a problem as a computer scientist by working on parts of the overall project. This helps keep on track and to not lose focus on what the goals are and keep user needs in mind to be able to satisfy all or most of their needs. My ethical responsibilities to the user and the organization is to give them a product that satisfies all or most of their needs and that it is simple to learn and use. Simplicity comes a long way when it comes to products because there is less time designing and teaching the end user and organization to use the product.
